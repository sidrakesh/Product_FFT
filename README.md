Product_FFT
===========

This program computes the product of two numbers by using Fast Fourier Transfrom technique.

The inputs are to be given as a single string each, i.e. if we wish to enter the number [1, 2, 3, 4], the single string "1 2 3 4" (inverted commas are for clarity) must be input upon the prompt "Enter input 1 : "

The output will be a space separated sequence of number denoting the product decimal coded digits.
